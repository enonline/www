We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\n\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.\n"},"relatedPosts":{"nodes":[{"id":"8e816c27-453e-53c6-8e42-64590e3412f1","frontmatter":{"title":"Great Gatsby","tags":["speeches"],"authors":[{"yamlId":"ghost","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#383848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/d6138/ghost.png","srcSet":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/d6138/ghost.png 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/416c3/ghost.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1}}}}],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/3564b/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/7284f/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 750w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/29ba9/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 1080w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/c8896/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 1366w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/3564b/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.jpg 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/57584/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.webp 750w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/984df/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.webp 1080w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/4a276/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.webp 1366w,\n/static/5fe84a92914ba64eae5b34bd85edd23b/2b8d7/marvin-meyer-794521-unsplash.webp 1500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}},"date":"1922-12-12T10:00:00.000Z"},"excerpt":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel…","timeToRead":2.5,"fields":{"slug":"great-gatsby"}},{"id":"18dd1a1f-573d-50d0-b9d0-43bac5fdc8c2","frontmatter":{"title":"A Full and Comprehensive Style Test","tags":["speeches"],"authors":[{"yamlId":"ghost","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#383848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/d6138/ghost.png","srcSet":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/d6138/ghost.png 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5f2c129e42248a92c87b13b4293950cf/416c3/ghost.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1}}}}],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/8dbcc/demo1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/7284f/demo1.jpg 750w,\n/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/29ba9/demo1.jpg 1080w,\n/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/8dbcc/demo1.jpg 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/57584/demo1.webp 750w,\n/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/984df/demo1.webp 1080w,\n/static/2cec9ec6dc6f9c79261c1302236d56ad/f2559/demo1.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}},"date":"2018-09-30T07:03:47.149Z"},"excerpt":"Below is just about everything you’ll need to style in the theme.
